            </p>

            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>
            provided by Journalism++ SAS, a French corporation, to users of Detective.io, thereafter the "User".
            </p>
            The following terms and conditions (hereafter also referred to as the "Agreement") govern the use of all the services, products, software (referred to collectively as the "Service" in this document) offered at Detective.io (the "Site"). The Service is offered subject to the User's acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein.
            Journalism++ reserves the right to update, amend and modify the Agreement at any time without prior notice or acceptance by the User. The Agreement is also applied to the use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, the User expresses his or her irrevocable acceptance of this Agreement.


            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                Detective.io is a data management solution. It lets the User create, update and mine knowledge bases intuitively. The User may create an Account through the sign-up form that will enable him or her to create Investigations. An Investigation is a dedicated space where data can be collected, sourced and mined by the Users and third parties. Some data from an Investigation can be downloaded by the User.
            </p>

            <p>
                The User also understands and agrees that the Service may include certain communications from Journalism++, such as but not limited to service announcements and administrative messages, that these communications are considered part of the Service and that the User as long as he or she is registered will not be able to opt out of receiving them.
            </p>
            <p>
            Journalism++ may at any time, at its sole discretion, and without prior notice modify the features of the Service. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Agreement.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Registration</h2>
            <p>
                The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the login data for his or her account, and is fully responsible for all activities that occur under his or her account. The User agrees to (a) immediately notify Journalism++ of any unauthorized use of his or her account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session. In consideration of use of the Service, the User agrees to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about him or herself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. Journalism++ assumes no duty to verify such information. Journalism++ may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Journalism++ cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the User’s failure to comply with the requirements stated in this .
            </p>

            <h2>3. Usage Policy & ownership of data</h2>
            <p>
                Journalism++ does not claim ownership over any content submitted on or through the Service. Content created by the User belongs to the User who created it. However, by uploading any content to the Service, the User agrees that Journalism++ may store and display (according to the privacy settings chosen by the owner of the Investigation the User contributes to) content created by the User. To the extent the User chooses to share any of his or her content with other users of the Service, the User agrees to allow these users to view the User’s content and, to the extent applicable, collaborate with the User.
            </p>
            <p>
            The User understands that all content created by the User is the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. This means that the User, and not Journalism++, is entirely responsible for all content that the User uploads, posts, transmits or otherwise makes available via the User’s Account. Journalism++ does not control the content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The User understands that by using the Service, the User may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Journalism++ be liable in any way for any data, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any data, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any data posted, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service. The User acknowledges that Journalism++ does not pre-screen data, but that Journalism++ and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse, modify or move any data that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Journalism++ and its designees shall have the right to remove any data that violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. The User agrees that he or she must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any data, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such data. The User acknowledges and agrees that Journalism++ may preserve data and may also disclose data to anyone if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
            </p>
            <p>(a) comply with legal process;</p>
            <p>(b) enforce the Agreement;</p>
            <p>(c) respond to claims that any data violates the rights of third-parties; or</p>
            <p>(d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Journalism++’ employees or shareholders, users of Detective.io and the public.</p>

            <p>
                If Journalism++ discloses data to comply with legal process or respond to claims that any data violates the rights of third-parties, to the extent permitted by law, regulation or legal process, Journalism++ agrees to provide the User to whom the data belongs with prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with the User in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The User understands that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including User data, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Should User data be found or reported to be in violation with, but not limited to, the following terms, it will be in Journalism++’ sole discretion as to what action should be taken. The User agrees that he or she will not:
            </p>

            <p>
                (a) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any data that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy (up to, but not excluding any address, email, phone number, or any other contact information without the written consent of the owner of such information), hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;

                (d) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any data transmitted through the Service;

            <p>
                (e) upload, post or otherwise transmit any data that the User do not have a right to transmit under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                If any user is reported to be in violation with the letter or spirit of these terms, Journalism++ retains the right to terminate such account at any time without further warning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Service can only be accessed from servers owned or leased by Journalism++.
            </p>
            <p>
                The User may not (and may not permit anyone else to) license the Service to any third party.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Proprietary rights</h2>

            <p>
                The User acknowledges and agrees that Journalism++ own all legal rights, title, interest, technology in and to the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Service (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). The User further acknowledges that the Service may contain information which is designated confidential by Journalism++ and that the User shall not disclose such information without Journalism++' prior written consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless the User has agreed otherwise in writing with Journalism++, nothing in the Terms gives the User a right to use any of Journalism++' or Detective.io's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Payment</h2>
            <p>
                Advanced features are available in the paid plans. Users can select a paid plan, after which Journalism++ sends them an invoice to be paid by money transfer. If a payment is overdue, Journalism++ will disable the User’s access to the features provided by the paid plan. Journalism++ may, at its sole discretion, at any time and for any reason, terminate the Service, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate a User’s account. In the event of suspension or termination, the User’s account will be disabled and the User may not be granted access to his or her account or any data contained in the User’s account, and Journalism++ may delete a User’s data, although residual copies of information may remain in Journalism++’ system for some time for back-up purposes. In the event of termination, Journalism++ may also withdraw and at its discretion reallocate the public web address of a User’s Account.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a User terminates his or her account, via means provided for cancellation on the Detective.io website, or via telephone call or email to Journalism++, and requests that Journalism++ deletes his or her data, Journalism++ will make all reasonable efforts to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                The User must contact Journalism++ by email to cancel his or her subscription. It is the User’s responsibility to make sure that Journalism++ received the email signalling the cancellation. If the User cancels his or her subscription within 15 calendar days of the date at which the invoice related to the subscription was issued, and requests a refund, Journalism++ will refund all payments he or she has made to Journalism++ within the 15 calendar days prior to the cancellation and refund request. If the User cancels a subscription and requests a refund later than 15 calendar days after the the date at which the invoice related to the subscription was issued, Journalism++ refunds the User in proportion of the remaining days of the subscription. In other words, refund = amount paid by User * ((date of cancellation - date of invoice) / 360).
            </p>

            <h2>6. No warranties</h2>
            <p>
                The User expressly understand and agree that its use of the Services is at its sole risk and that the Service is provided "as is". Journalism++ is obligated to provide the Service on a best-effort basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The usage of the Service has no warranty. Journalism++ will take no responsibility for any loss, risk of any kind obtained through the usage of the Service. The User will be solely responsible for any damage to its computer system or other device or loss of data that results from the download of any material from the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>
                In no event may Journalism++ be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special consequential or exemplary damages which may be incurred by the User, however caused and under any theory of liability. This shall include, but not be limited to, any loss of profit (whether incurred directly or indirectly), any loss of goodwill or business reputation, any loss of data suffered, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or other intangible loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the User's responsibility to personally backup any content uploaded to the Service and keep its accounts details and other sensitive information secure and confidential.
            </p>
            <p>
                No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from Journalism++ or through or from the Service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms. Journalism++ further expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether expressed or implied.
            </p>
            <h2>8. Severability clause</h2>
            <p>
                Should any term hereof be invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining terms.
            </p>
            <h2>9. Applicable law</h2>
            <p>
                The Parties partake in the Agreement in good faith. They shall address any dispute arising from the Agreement through physical or online meetings and discussions. Only if no agreement has been found 2 weeks after the dispute has first been notified in writing by one of the Parties shall the Parties request the assistance of a court of law.
            </p>
            <p>
                This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with French laws. All disputes arising from this contractual relationship shall be referred to the Paris tribunal of commerce.
